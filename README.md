# Drupal Learning
This my record of using web-based resources to get started with Drupal

## Code Karate
[Code Karate](http://codekarate.com/) - Learn Drupal in 30 days (daily email series). A tour through Drupal and a chance to learn about its set-up and features in a structured way. Each email introduces aspects of Drupal and manageable chunks of theory while encouraging further experimentation. [Activity Log](code_karate.md)
