# Drupal Learning
This my record of using web-based resources to get started with Drupal

## Code Karate
[Code Karate](http://codekarate.com/) - Learn Drupal in 30 days (daily email series). A tour through Drupal and a chance to learn about its set-up and features in a structured way. Each email introduces aspects of Drupal and manageable chunks of theory while encouraging further experimentation.

### Day 1: Installing Drupal
- Using Acquia Dev Desktop
- Installed a local Drupal site and Database with MAMP
- Used Acquia Cloud Free
- *Theory:* Purpose and use of files folder; Introduction to caching in PHP
- **Still to do:** Complete successful install using [Vagrant Drupal Development](https://www.drupal.org/node/2008758?utm_source=Drupal+Basics+Guide+%28Daily+Email%29&utm_campaign=34c5c273ef-Drupal_Basics_Course_Day1&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_62853d349e-34c5c273ef-336738877&mc_cid=34c5c273ef&mc_eid=2356d42857) (in progress);
